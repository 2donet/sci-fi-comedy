# Sci-fi ecological comedy
Film explaining why nature is important in a humorous way. This project is for creating a movie but also testing in real-time how to develop movies publicly on the Internet. It's going to be made by posts on Social Media (open discussion on the story, events, dialogues, characters psychology, etc.), sharing source files (so that anyone could edit/mix), streaming services (for people to see in real-time how the shots look like), and chaos (it is inevitable for this initiative). Most likely it will be a 100 minutes long animation created on a game engine with volunteers' voices.


### Plot
In 2050 due to climate changes a mission to habit a faraway planet is sent. Soon after settlers' arrival a problem (currently undefined) occurs. Crew contacts the earth on how to solve it, but has to wait for an hour for their answer, so they try to do it the whole movie in various ways. When the Earth responds problem is solved with one click.
